Notes:
------------------------
So First a spawner's location is moved
 That spawner is saved
The spawner suddently has a valid position.
 How do you find that spawner?

So first a spawner's location is saved
 Spawner is moved
The location will have to be moved accordingly, but should result in finding the spawner?


CopyPaste:
After working on this for a long while I've made a version that i'm comfortable with releasing to the public!
CustomRegionSaves is a mod that allows the game to remain playable after adding/removing custom regions!
Objects, spawns, sticks, and consumables should remain in their correct locations/states after adding/removing custom regions!
Creatures that spawn/have a den in a pipe that has been removed/made invalid will attempt to move into a nearby valid pipe!
The mod should work with both CRS and merge regions.
*Note that this mod cannot restore an already corrupted file, and should only prevent the future corruption of files that already work.
