TODO : Fix creature ids (They are based off of their original spawner by the looks of things)
TODO : Fix respawn ids







BACKLOG : Eventually look for everything that is in savestate and regionstate!





So First a spawner's location is moved
 That spawner is saved
The spawner suddently has a valid position.
 How do you find that spawner?

So first a spawner's location is saved
 Spawner is moved
The location will have to be moved accordingly, but should result in finding the spawner?


CopyPaste:
After working on this for a long while I've made a version that i'm comfortable with releasing to the public!
CustomRegionSaves is a mod that allows the game to remain playable after adding/removing custom regions!
Objects, spawns, sticks, and consumables should remain in their correct locations/states after adding/removing custom regions!
Creatures that spawn/have a den in a pipe that has been removed/made invalid will attempt to move into a nearby valid pipe!
The mod should work with both CRS and merge regions.
*Note that this mod cannot restore an already corrupted file, and should only prevent the future corruption of files that already work.

Translating respawns/Spawners:
 Anything that saves it's EntityID will save a spawner and an ID number.
   Creature's ID numbers do not change, since it defines most properties of the creature itself.
   However, it is possible for the spawner ID to be incorrect, since the IDs of spawners in a world can "shift" when the number of spawners change.
   (By spawner, this is talking about CreatureSpawners, not arena spawners)
   A spawner ID is the region index + the index in the region. (which means that not only can the region of a spawner ID can shift, but so can the position in a region!)
 There are two types of spawners used in the game: SimpleSpawner and Lineage
