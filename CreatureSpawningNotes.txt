About creature spawning:

WorldLoader.GeneratePopulation(bool)
  True? ProceedLinages: Set in startup file?
  For spawners.count
  FindingCreatures is called with the cntr going from startOfCreatures to endOfCreatures
  Cntr is supposedly line number?
  An array is the line split by :
  If the first part is "LINEAGE"
    AddLineageFromString(split line array)
  Otherwise
    AddSpawnersFromString(split line array)
    
Apparently you can have offscreen dens Lineage.
